Ajax (also AJAX; /ˈeɪdʒæks/; short for asynchronous JavaScript and XML)[1][2][3] is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.[4] In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute JSON for XML due to the advantages of being native to JavaScript.[5]

        The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws.[9] The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students.[10]
