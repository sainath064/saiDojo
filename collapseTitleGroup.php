    <div data-dojo-type="dijit.TitlePane" open="false" title="Naresh"><p>Naresh made his foray into films under the direction of Ravi Babu in the film Allari, an adult comedy in which he played the role of an 18-year-old who is infatuated with a beautiful girl. His performance <b>was well praised by the critics</b>.<br> idlebrain.com wrote, "Naresh is a natural actor and he suited the role perfectly. His dialogue delivery is perfect and has very good timing in doing comedy.</p>  He has a bright future ahead, if he chooses his future projects carefully."[8] The film did exceptionally well at the Box office, giving him recognition as "Allari Naresh". However, his next film Dhana Laxmi I Love You, a remake of Hera Pheri, received negative reviews, ultimately faltering at the Box office. His third release Thotti Gang, co-starring Prabhu Deva and Sunil, was successful at the Box office, which was followed by two flops Juniors, the remake of Thulluvadho Ilamai and Praanam, which featured him in a dual role.
